# HearthstoneGoldenCardWallpaper

A Live wallpaper for Android devices which shows Golden Hearthstone Cards

Currently set to download a random hearthstone card gif from hearthhead every hour and setting it as the background image.

Averages around 1mb every 2 hours or 1gb every 85 days (assuming a phone is open to the home screen for 85 days straight).

Since this is mostly a proof of concept I recognize that the code is at a professional standard and plan on tidying everything up in the coming weeks.

I am open to all kinds of constructive criticism.
